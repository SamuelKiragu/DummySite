            <h3>Favourite Movie</h3>
            <h4>Title: <span>Kung Fu Panda</span></h4>
            <h4>Genre: <span>Action, Animation, Adventure</span></h4>
            <p>This movie follows the story of Po (voice of Jack Black), a Panda who works in his father’s noodle shop, but dreams of becoming a Kung Fu champion. When Po learns that the village is hosting a tournament to nominate a Dragon Warrior, he makes his way to the Jade Palace to watch the festivities.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, Po’s journey is made slower by the noodle trolley his father insists he take along. He arrives just as the palace gates are closing.  After making several failed attempts to make it over the high palace walls, Po finally launches himself into the tournament arena with the aid of several firecrackers strapped to a chair. After regaining consciousness, he discovers that the wise tortoise has selected him as the new Dragon Warrior, much to the surprise of Kung Fu Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) and his ‘Furious Five’ disciples (Angelina Jolie, Jackie Chan, Randall Duk Kim, David Cross and Lucy Liu).</p>
            <p>Shortly afterwards, the evil snow-leopard Tai Lung escapes from the dungeon in which he is imprisoned. He vows to wreak vengeance on Po and Shifu for preventing him from taking the mantle of Dragon Warrior himself. Realising that the overweight and out-of-condition Po will be no match for Tai Lung, the Furious Five go into battle on his behalf.  Meanwhile, Master Shifu begins training Po and eventually shows him the ancient Dragon Scroll, whose message is believed to reveal the secret of the invincible warrior. When the Furious Five come back defeated, Po bravely faces Tai Lung and a life-and-death battle ensues.</p>
